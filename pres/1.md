A circuit breaker can be useful when a call depends on a remote service (http call, DB request) or is required to finish within a given timeframe.

It is a [micro-services pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/reliability/circuit-breaker.html) which allows to:
- quarantine a failing / unstable service
- avoid overloading a service
- prevent cascading failures by protecting the source system from running out of resources while trying to handle requests incorporating unavailable services

A circuit breaker acts as a proxy. It is used by the source system to contact a remote service.
When the remote service is not responding (in a timely manner), the circuit breaker runs a fallback procedure and does not contact the remote service letting it heal.
After some time, the circuit breaker passes a subset of calls to test the remote service.
